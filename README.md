I used the Jasmine Framework to run tests on this Feed Reader app, which uses the Google Feed Reader API. I created specs to test functionality, including asynchronous requests, and learned how to break the code in order to test if my specs were actually working. To run my project, open the index.html file in your browser and check out my specs.
